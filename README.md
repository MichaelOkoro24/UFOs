# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis:
In this module we will be helping Dana use Javascript to display UFOs data from a table. Then using Javascript to manipulate the data with filters on an HTML page. 

## Results:
When you first enter the web page under the paragraph there are 5 filters. With the date, city, state, country, and shape.  ![Screen Shot 2022-08-29 at 12 52 29 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106411743/187254033-ffc0da04-ecac-4f87-9000-58ef42550911.png)

Once you fill out the filters press the "Enter" key to activate the search. The results will show from under the filter with a comment giving you a description of the possible UFO.

## Summary:
Overall the project was a success. We were successful with helping Dana make a lively webpage about UFOs using Javascript and HTML.  
One draw back of this webpage is the filter search. It can be minimized or put in a dropdown menu so it doesn't take up as much space on the webpage.
One thing that can be added this webpage could be is a drop down menu that could navigate to different parts of the page.
Another thong that could be added to this webpage could be more images of UFOs around the page to make the page pop out more.
